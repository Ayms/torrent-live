## Overview

A [*Distributed Hash Table (DHT)*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) is a decentralized distributed system that provides a lookup table similar to a hash table.

*k-bucket* is an implementation of a storage mechanism for keys within a DHT. It stores `contact` objects which represent locations and addresses of nodes in the decentralized distributed system. `contact` objects are typically identified by a SHA-1 hash, however this restriction is lifted in this implementation. Additionally, node ids of different lengths can be compared.

This Kademlia DHT k-bucket implementation is meant to be as minimal as possible. It assumes that `contact` objects consist only of `id`. It is useful, and necessary, to attach other properties to a `contact`. For example, one may want to attach `ip` and `port` properties, which allow an application to send IP traffic to the `contact`. However, this information is extraneous and irrelevant to the operation of a k-bucket.

### arbiter function

This *k-bucket* implementation implements a conflict resolution mechanism using an `arbiter` function. The purpose of the `arbiter` is to choose between two `contact` objects with the same `id` but perhaps different properties and determine which one should be stored.  As the `arbiter` function returns the actual object to be stored, it does not need to make an either/or choice, but instead could perform some sort of operation and return the result as a new object that would then be stored. See [kBucket.update(contact, index)](#kbucketupdatecontact-index) for detailed semantics of which `contact` (`incumbent` or `candidate`) is selected.

For example, an `arbiter` function implementing a `vectorClock` mechanism would look something like:

```javascript
// contact example
var contact = {
    id: new Buffer('contactId'),
    vectorClock: 0
};

function arbiter(incumbent, candidate) {
    if (incumbent.vectorClock > candidate.vectorClock) {
        return incumbent;
    }
    return candidate;
};
```

Alternatively, consider an arbiter that implements a Grow-Only-Set CRDT mechanism:

```javascript
// contact example
var contact = {
    id: new Buffer('workerService'),
    workerNodes: {
        '17asdaf7effa2': { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 1337 },
        '17djsyqeryasu': { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 1338 }
    }
};

function arbiter(incumbent, candidate) {
    // we create a new object so that our selection is guaranteed to replace
    // the incumbent
    var merged = {
        id: incumbent.id, // incumbent.id === candidate.id within an arbiter
        workerNodes: incumbent.workerNodes
    };

    Object.keys(candidate.workerNodes).forEach(function (workerNodeId) {
        merged.workerNodes[workerNodeId] = candidate.workerNodes[workerNodeId];
    });

    return merged;
}
```

Notice that in the above case, the Grow-Only-Set assumes that each worker node has a globally unique id.

### KBucket

Implementation of a Kademlia DHT k-bucket used for storing contact (peer node) information.

For a step by step example of k-bucket operation you may find the following slideshow useful: [Distribute All The Things](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11qGZlPWu6vEAhA7p3qsQaQtWH7KofEC9dMeBFZ1gYeA/edit#slide=id.g1718cc2bc_0661).

KBucket starts off as a single k-bucket with capacity of _k_. As contacts are added, once the _k+1_ contact is added, the k-bucket is split into two k-buckets. The split happens according to the first bit of the contact node id. The k-bucket that would contain the local node id is the "near" k-bucket, and the other one is the "far" k-bucket. The "far" k-bucket is marked as _don't split_ in order to prevent further splitting. The contact nodes that existed are then redistributed along the two new k-buckets and the old k-bucket becomes an inner node within a tree data structure.

As even more contacts are added to the "near" k-bucket, the "near" k-bucket will split again as it becomes full. However, this time it is split along the second bit of the contact node id. Again, the two newly created k-buckets are marked "near" and "far" and the "far" k-bucket is marked as _don't split_. Again, the contact nodes that existed in the old bucket are redistributed. This continues as long as nodes are being added to the "near" k-bucket, until the number of splits reaches the length of the local node id.

As more contacts are added to the "far" k-bucket and it reaches its capacity, it does not split. Instead, the k-bucket emits a "ping" event (register a listener: `kBucket.on('ping', function (oldContacts, newContact) {...});` and includes an array of old contact nodes that it hasn't heard from in a while and requires you to confirm that those contact nodes still respond (literally respond to a PING RPC). If an old contact node still responds, it should be re-added (`kBucket.add(oldContact)`) back to the k-bucket. This puts the old contact on the "recently heard from" end of the list of nodes in the k-bucket. If the old contact does not respond, it should be removed (`kBucket.remove(oldContact)`) and the new contact being added now has room to be stored (`kBucket.add(newContact)`).

#### KBucket.distance(firstId, secondId)

  * `firstId`: _Buffer_ Buffer containing first id.

  * `index`: _Integer_ The index in the bucket where contact exists (index has already been computed in previous calculation).

Updates the `contact` by using the `arbiter` function to compare the incumbent and the candidate. If `arbiter` function selects the old `contact` but the candidate is some new `contact`, then the new `contact` is abandoned. If `arbiter` function selects the old `contact` and the candidate is that same old `contact`, the `contact` is marked as most recently contacted (by being moved to the right/end of the bucket array). If `arbiter` function selects the new `contact`, the old `contact` is removed and the new `contact` is marked as most recently contacted.

#### Event: 'ping'

  * `oldContacts`: _Array_ The array of contacts to ping.
  * `newContact`: _Object_ The new contact to be added if one of old contacts does not respond.

Emitted every time a contact is added that would exceed the capacity of a _don't split_ k-bucket it belongs to.
